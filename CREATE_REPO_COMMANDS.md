# Repository Creation Commands

Since the `dashboardengine` repository doesn't exist under @krupaljpatel, you'll need to create it first.

## Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not available
# brew install gh (macOS) or visit https://github.com/cli/cli

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Create the repository
gh repo create dashboardengine --public --description "Multi-source consumer application for files from File System, FTP, MQ, Kafka, and databases"

# Add remote and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/krupaljpatel/dashboardengine.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Create pull request (after making changes)
gh pr create --title "Phase 1: Core Spring Boot Framework Implementation" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

## Option 2: Using GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `dashboardengine`
3. Description: "Multi-source consumer application for files from File System, FTP, MQ, Kafka, and databases"
4. Make it Public
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Create repository

Then run:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/krupaljpatel/dashboardengine.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Current Status
âœ… Phase 1 Implementation Complete  
âœ… Git repository initialized with initial commit  
âœ… All files staged and committed
